# 📊 Quantitative Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing a **basic quantitative analysis** using Microsoft Excel.  
The objective of the task is to **analyze a numerical dataset and count how many values are two-digit numbers**.  
The exercise demonstrates practical usage of Excel functions for data filtering and logical evaluation.

## 🎯 Objective
To identify and count all **two-digit numbers (10–99)** present in a given dataset using Excel.

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Description
- The dataset consists of multiple rows and columns containing numeric values.
- Values include:
  - Single-digit numbers
  - Two-digit numbers
  - Three-digit numbers
- The data is organized in a tabular format for easy analysis.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Microsoft Excel**
- Spreadsheet functions for logical comparison and counting

---

## 📐 Methodology
The task is completed by applying logical conditions to check whether each value in the dataset:
- Is greater than or equal to **10**
- Is less than or equal to **99**

Only the values satisfying both conditions are counted.
